Qus-1 ===> Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 

ans ===> * HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, 
          while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
         * HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
         * There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2
          which was created in 2015.
         * HTTP1.1 uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages, But It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
         * HTTP1.1 usest works on the textual format, HTTP.2 is a binary protocol.
         * HTTP1.1 compresses data by itself, HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.
         
         
Qus-2 ===> Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ?

ans ===>   * Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
          These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 
          in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
           * A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 
          Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. 
           The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. 
           * These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
          An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. 
          A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
