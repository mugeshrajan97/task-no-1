Qus-1 ===> Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 

ans ===> * HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, 
          while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
         * HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
         * There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2
          which was created in 2015.
         * HTTP1.1 uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages, But It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
         * HTTP1.1 usest works on the textual format, HTTP.2 is a binary protocol.
         * HTTP1.1 compresses data by itself, HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.
